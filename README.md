Cineplus
Cine Plus is a program created for the improvement of customer service, as its name says, it is designed thinking for a cinema. This will show us four windows, which we are going to summarize in:

Start: this window is where the cashier workers identify themselves and in the same way enter a password; if the user and password are correct, the program will send you a message which will indicate that you can enter the next window. Our second window is named:

Ticket Office: in our second window we have the images of the movies, their schedules, and the rooms where they are available. Once the movie section and what it entails are selected, at the bottom it has the ticket sales; in this, we will find two different prices: one for adults and one for minors, where we can enter quantities. When confirming your choice and purchase, it will allow you to enter the next window, which is named:

Candy Store: our third window, in which we will find the food for purchase that the cinema allows you to bring in; here you will find the three most popular combos with their price and a reference image. Likewise, there are individual products, which are popcorn and drinks of different flavors and sizes. When confirming the purchase, it will allow you to enter our last window, which is named:

Ticket: this last window has the purpose of giving us a summary of what was selected in the first three windows and gives us the subtotal.
Below these three, the total is calculated and displayed; when confirming the purchase, it is counted as sold, and only the payment for the sold products is expected.

Not forgetting to mention that our four windows have two buttons, which allow you to move forward or go back to correct any error.
